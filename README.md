# Nice to meet you, I'm Tianhui!

This is my [personal website](https://tianhuiyang.me/), developed in `React` and `TypeScript`. I used [styled-components](https://styled-components.com/) for styling and hosted this website with a custom domain on Netlify.

**Improvements from my previous site**
- removed `Bootstrap` dependency
- used modern `React` library instead of vanilla `HTML5/CSS3`
- improved styling practices
- standardized layout + design
- routing with `react-router-dom`

Hope you enjoy :)
